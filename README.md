## Introduction

**MASSE** is the first **M**ulti-**A**gent **S**ystem for **S**tructural **E**ngineering, integrating LLM-based agents directly into real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental yet traditionally stagnant domain that has seen little digital workflow innovation for decades. Leveraging recent advances in LLM reasoning, planning, and tool use, MASSE automates core tasks such as code interpretation, load analysis, and capacity verification. Validated on real-world case studies, MASSE reduces expert effort from hours to minutes while improving reliability and accuracy, enabling immediate deployment in professional practice.

## Analogy of future human-AI collaborations

Traditional practice relies on long apprenticeships, with senior engineers transferring expertise to junior engineers through mentorship and problem solving. In contrast, LLM-based multi-agent systems instantiate scalable junior engineer agents that inherit workflows, perform specialized tasks, and coordinate under senior engineers' oversight. As these systems evolve toward self-planning and adaptive learning, fully agentic hierarchies where senior engineer agents direct junior engineer agents could transform engineering into a continuously improving, highly efficient practice.

## Tools: Autoresearch Lab (experimental) William Embry

This repo includes an experimental “Autoresearch Lab” under `tools/autoresearch-lab/`. It is a deterministic benchmark harness for iterating on MASSE and OpenSees modeling defaults in a repeatable loop:

- run a fixed benchmark suite
- score results vs baselines and enforce engineering gates
- record a keep or discard decision plus a lightweight ledger

Quick start (from repo root):

```bash
python tools/autoresearch-lab/run_all.py --tag exp1 --description "what changed" --mode auto

## MASSE Framework

Reflecting this practical organizational model, MASSE introduces three distinct agent teams within a simulated structural engineering consultancy environment: Analyst Team, Engineer Team and Management Team. Each agent is assigned a unique role, goal, and set of constraints, and is further equipped with predefined contexts and specialized tools aligned with these responsibilities. MASSE organizes these agent roles into the following structured teams. More detailed descriptions can be found in the appendices.

![MASSE Framework](assets/pipeline.png)

> *MASSE* Overall Framework. The **Analyst Team** combines four layers of tools (LLMs, FEM solvers, engineering documents, and fundamentals) to enable multi-agent collaboration. The **Engineer Team** performs limit state verification (Response<Capacity), while the **Project Manager** coordinates workflows and the **Structural Memory** stores analysis data. The **Safety Manager** conducts the final adequacy check. Three specialized teams are shown: **Analyst** (data extraction and analysis), **Engineer** (design and verification), and **Management** (coordination and decision-making).

### Analyst Team

The Analyst Team automates the preparation of structural engineering data by coordinating specialized agents that extract loading conditions, retrieve information from engineering documentation, execute load determination using rule-based methods, and generate structural models. At a high level, this team transforms unstructured project information and regulatory data into standardized engineering inputs, ensuring that subsequent model, design and verification tasks can be carried out with consistency, efficiency, and scalability.

![Analyst Team](assets/analyst_team.png)

### Engineer Team

The Engineer Team operationalizes the data prepared by the Analyst Team by conducting structural analysis, structural design, and adequacy verification. In broad terms, this team integrates automated simulations and capacity checks to evaluate structural integrity under prescribed loading conditions, enabling systematic, tool-driven assessment of design safety and structural performance.

### Manager Team

The Management Team oversees and coordinates the overall MASSE workflow, transforming analytical outputs from the Analyst Team and Engineer Team into authoritative engineering decisions. Broadly speaking, this team manages task allocation, integrates intermediate results, and issues final structural safety conclusions that guide the entire system. As illustrated in the figure below, the Safety Manager plays a central role within this process by delivering the ultimate adequacy verdict, ensuring that all decisions are consistent with professional safety standards.

## Installation

- **Clone MASSE:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/masse.git
  cd masse
  ```

- **Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:**
  ```bash
  conda create -n masse python=3.10
  conda activate masse
  ```

- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Required APIs

You will need the OpenAI API for all the agents (default configuration), and optionally the Anthropic API if you want to use Claude models.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

**Note:** The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model by default. You can modify the LLM provider settings in `masseagents/default_config.py` to use different models or providers.

## Tools: Autoresearch Lab (experimental)

This repo includes a deterministic benchmark harness for iterating on MASSE and OpenSees modeling defaults.

- Runs a fixed benchmark suite
- Scores results vs baselines and checks engineering gates
- Records a keep or discard decision plus a simple ledger

Quick start from the repo root:

```bash
python tools/autoresearch-lab/run_all.py --tag exp1 --description "what changed" --mode auto
```

Roadmap:
- Gen 1 (current): deterministic harness (run → score → decision → ledger)
- Gen 2: proposal interface + constrained editable spec, still gated by this harness
- Gen 3: optional distributed runs / queue integration

See `tools/autoresearch-lab/README.md` for details on specs, gates, and outputs.

## MASSE Package

### Implementation Details

The `MASSE` system is built with `AutoGen` for flexibility and modularity. The framework uses `gpt-4o` as the default LLM model for all agents. For testing purposes, we recommend using `gpt-4o` or `gpt-3.5-turbo` to save costs, as the framework makes many API calls during the multi-agent workflow.

### Python Usage

You can use `MASSE` within your Python code by importing the `masseagents` module and initializing a `StructuralAnalysisWorkflow()` object. The `.run_full_analysis()` function returns the analysis results. Alternatively, you can run `main.py` to use the graphical interface.

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from masseagents.workflows.structural_workflow import StructuralAnalysisWorkflow
from masseagents.default_config import get_default_config

# Initialize workflow with default configuration
config = get_default_config()
workflow = StructuralAnalysisWorkflow(config)

# Run analysis

The beam is a 4 inch Z-section beam; on the side elevation the gap between two posts is 3.5 ft wide and the post is 16.0 ft tall with three floors at 4.0 ft, 8.5 ft and 13.0 ft; pallet weights are 1250 lbs at 4.0 ft, 750 lbs at 8.5 ft, 500 lbs at 13.0 ft. The columns are steel U-channels (3.079 in x 2.795 in x 0.0787 in, 16.0 ft long, E = 29,000 kip/in^2) and the braces are steel U-channels (1.0 in x 1.0 in x 0.054 in, length 4.3 ft). Two elastic beam-columns run from (0, 0)->(0, 16.0) and (3.5, 0)->(3.5, 16.0). 8 pin-ended truss braces link (0, 0.5)->(3.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5)->(0, 3), (0, 3)->(3.5, 5.5), (3.5, 5.5)->(0, 8), (0, 8)->(3.5, 10.5), (3.5, 10.5)->(0, 13), (0, 13)->(3.5, 15.5), (3.5, 15.5)->(0, 15.5). Fixed supports at (0, 0) and (3.5, 0). Point loads applied to the left column at 4.0 ft, 8.5 ft, 13.0 ft. Coordinates in feet (1 ft = 12 in), forces in kip, stiffness in kip/in^2."
result = workflow.run_full_analysis(problem_description, location="Nanaimo, BC", problem_id="1")

# Access results
print(f"Final Result: {result['final_result']}")
print(f"Safety Status: {result['safety_status']}")
```

The default configuration can be adjusted for LLMs, temperature, max rounds, etc.

**Custom Configuration:**

```python
from masseagents.workflows.structural_workflow import StructuralAnalysisWorkflow
from masseagents.default_config import get_default_config

# Create custom configuration
config = get_default_config()
config["llm_model"] = "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"  # Use a different model
config["temperature"] = 0  # Set temperature
config["max_round"] = 10  # Increase max rounds
config["max_tokens"] = 4000  # Adjust max tokens

# Initialize workflow with custom config
workflow = StructuralAnalysisWorkflow(config, log_dir="logs/custom_analysis")

# Run analysis
result = workflow.run_full_analysis(
    problem_description="A racking system in Nanaimo, BC. This system has 2 bays with 8.0 ft beam length; there are 3 pallets on each beam.

The default configuration uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model. You can modify the LLM provider settings in `masseagents/default_config.py` to use different models (OpenAI or Anthropic) or adjust other system parameters. The full list of configurations can be viewed in `masseagents/default_config.py`.

## Running an Example

This section demonstrates how to use MASSE to analyze a structural engineering problem. We will solve a racking system design problem to illustrate the workflow.

### Problem Description

We aim to analyze a racking system located in Nanaimo, BC. The problem description is as follows:

> A racking system in Nanaimo, BC. This system has 2 bays with 8.0 ft beam length; there are 3 pallets on each beam. The beam is a 4 inch Z-section beam; on the side elevation the gap between two posts is 3.5 ft wide and the post is 16.0 ft tall with three floors at 4.0 ft, 8.5 ft and 13.0 ft; pallet weights are 1250 lbs at 4.0 ft, 750 lbs at 8.5 ft, 500 lbs at 13.0 ft. The columns are steel U-channels (3.079 in x 2.795 in x 0.0787 in, 16.0 ft long, E = 29,000 kip/in^2) and the braces are steel U-channels (1.0 in x 1.0 in x 0.054 in, length 4.3 ft). Two elastic beam-columns run from (0, 0)->(0, 16.0) and (3.5, 0)->(3.5, 16.0). 8 pin-ended truss braces link (0, 0.5)->(3.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5)->(0, 3), (0, 3)->(3.5, 5.5), (3.5, 5.5)->(0, 8), (0, 8)->(3.5, 10.5), (3.5, 10.5)->(0, 13), (0, 13)->(3.5, 15.5), (3.5, 15.5)->(0, 15.5). Fixed supports at (0, 0) and (3.5, 0). Point loads applied to the left column at 4.0 ft, 8.5 ft, 13.0 ft. Coordinates in feet (1 ft = 12 in), forces in kip, stiffness in kip/in^2.

![Racking System](assets/racking_system.png)

The goal is to determine whether this racking system is structurally adequate under the specified loading conditions, following Canadian building code requirements for seismic analysis in Nanaimo, BC.

### Using the Graphical Interface

MASSE provides a user-friendly graphical interface for running structural analyses. Launch the interface by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

![UI Example](assets/ui_example.png)

The interface consists of several key components:

- **Left Panel - Analysis Controls:**
  - **Problem ID**: Select or enter a problem ID (1-100) from the dataset
  - **LLM Model**: Choose the language model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `o4-mini`)
  - **Problem Description**: Displays the loaded problem description in a scrollable text area
  - **Run Analysis Button**: Initiates the multi-agent analysis workflow

- **Right Panel - Geometry Visualization:**
  - Displays a visual representation of the structural system
  - Shows columns (in red), braces (in blue), supports, and applied loads
  - Updates automatically when a problem is loaded

- **Status Bar**: Shows the current status of the analysis (e.g., "Ready", "Running analysis...", "Analysis completed")

To run the example:

1. Launch the interface using `python main.py`
2. Enter or select the problem ID corresponding to the racking system
3. Click "Load Problem" to load the problem description and visualize the geometry
4. Select your preferred LLM model
5. Click "🚀 Run Analysis" to start the multi-agent workflow
6. Wait for the analysis to complete (the system will coordinate multiple specialized agents)
7. Review the results, which are saved in `logs/<model_name>/problem_<id>/`

The analysis results include detailed information about building parameters, seismic loads, structural model, internal forces, and the final safety assessment.
